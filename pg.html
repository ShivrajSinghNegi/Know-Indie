	<h4 class="title">The Essentials: Bars, Tempo, and Rhythm</h4>
	<ol class="list">
		<li>
			<span><b>What’s a Bar?</b></span>
			<ul>
				<li>A bar (or measure) is a way to break music into smaller chunks. Most songs are in 4/4 time, which means there are 4 beats in one bar.</li>
				<li>Example: If you count “1, 2, 3, 4” while listening to a song, each “1” marks the start of a new bar.</li>
				<li>Bars help organize your song. When writing lyrics, you often match your words to these beats.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>What’s Tempo?</b></span>
			<ul>
				<li>Tempo is the speed of your song, measured in BPM (beats per minute)</li>
				<li>Tempo sets the vibe of your song. A slower tempo feels relaxed, while a faster one gets people moving.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>What’s Rhythm?</b></span>
			<ul>
				<li>Rhythm is how you arrange the beats and notes in your song. It’s the groove that makes people tap their feet or nod their heads.</li>
				<li>Keep your rhythm simple at first. Overcomplicating can make your song hard to follow.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h4 class="title">Basic Song Structure</h4>
	<ol class="list">
		<li><b>Intro-</b> It is the small section of song which is at starting and it majorly focuses on setting theme for the rest of the song</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Chorus-</b>The Heart of the Song</span>
			<ul>
				<li>This is the big moment—the catchy part people hum in the shower or scream in the car. It usually repeats after verses, and it’s where you drive home the main idea of your song.</li>
				<li>Example: "Started from the bottom, now we’re here!" (Drake – Started From the Bottom)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Pre-Chorus-</b>The Build-up</span>
			<ul>
				<li>The pre-chorus is like the hype crew for the chorus. It comes right before the chorus and gets the energy up, so the chorus hits harder.</li>
				<li>Example: "I’m beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God..." (Eminem – Rap God)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Post-Chorus-</b>The Afterparty</span>
			<ul>
				<li>This is the part that comes right after the chorus. It’s like a mini-extension that keeps the vibe going before moving back to the verse.</li>
				<li>Example: "To the window, to the wall..." (Lil Jon – Get Low after the hook)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Verse-</b>The Storyteller</span>
			<ul>
				<li>The verse is where you explain the “why” behind your song. It’s like the storytelling part—less flashy than the chorus but super important for setting the scene.</li>
				<li>Example: "It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine..." (The Notorious B.I.G. – Juicy)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Bridge-</b>The Plot twist</span>
			<ul>
				<li>The bridge is a short section that takes the song in a different direction—musically or lyrically. Think of it as a breather or a curveball.</li>
				<li>Example: "If you havin’ girl problems, I feel bad for you, son..." (JAY-Z – 99 Problems)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Outro-</b>The Goodbye</span>
			<ul>
				<li>The outro is how you wrap things up. It could fade out, repeat the chorus, or bring in something new. Think of it as the closing scene in your musical movie.</li>
				<li>Example: "I’m out for presidents to represent me..." (Nas – The World Is Yours)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

	</ol>	


	<h4 class="title">Literary devices</h4>
	<ol class="list">
		<li>
			<span><b>Alliteration: </b>This is when words in a line start with the same consonant sound. It’s like a tongue twister that adds rhythm to your lyrics.</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Example: "Humble hustler, stacking hundreds" (J. Cole)</li>
				<li>Why It Works: It creates a cool, catchy rhythm that’s easy to remember.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Assonance: </b>This is like alliteration, but with vowel sounds. It gives your lines a smooth, connected vibe</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Example: "I made the change from a common thief / To up close and personal with Robin Leach" (The Notorious B.I.G. – Juicy)</li>
				<li>Why It Works: It adds flow and makes your words feel tied together.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Metaphor: </b>This compares two things to add deeper meaning, without using “like” or “as.”</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Example: "My mind is a weapon, my pen is a blade" (Kendrick Lamar)</li>
				<li>Why It Works: It’s creative and lets you say big things in few words.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Simile: </b>This is like a metaphor, but it uses “like” or “as” to compare.</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Example: "Sleepin’ on me like a futon" (J. Cole)</li>
				<li>Why It Works: It’s direct, relatable, and often clever.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Personification: </b>This gives human traits to things that aren’t human, making your lyrics more alive.</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Example: "The streets keep calling me back" (Nas – NY State of Mind)</li>
				<li>Why It Works: It helps your audience connect emotionally with the imagery.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Hyperbole: </b>This is just a fancy word for exaggeration. It makes your lines bigger, louder, and more dramatic.</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Example: "I got so much money, I could buy the moon" (Lil Wayne)</li>
				<li>Why It Works: It grabs attention and adds flair to your bars.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Imagery: </b>This is about painting pictures with your words. Make listeners see what you’re saying.</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Example: "I got a clear view of heaven, this must be what God sees" (Kanye West – Good Morning)</li>
				<li>Why It Works: It brings your audience into your world and makes your lyrics unforgettable.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Symbolism: </b>This is when something represents something bigger or deeper.</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Example: "I got the crown, I’m the king of the jungle" (Kendrick Lamar)</li>
				<li>Why It Works: It adds layers to your lyrics, making them feel meaningful.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Rhythm and meter: </b>This is the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables, keeping your lines flowing with the beat.</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Example: "Uh, uh, you know I’m back like I never left / Another sprint, another step" (Logic – 44 More)</li>
				<li>Why It Works: It makes your lyrics fit the beat perfectly and keeps listeners hooked.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span><b>Rhyme: </b>The classic one! Rhyming words at the end of your lines—or even within them—make your bars flow better.</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Example: "So if the devil wear Prada and Adam Eve wear nada / I’m in between but way more fresher" (Kanye West – Can't Tell Me Nothing)</li>
				<li>Why It Works: Rhymes make your lyrics memorable and satisfying to hear.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
